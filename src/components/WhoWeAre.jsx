        Student Sustainability Summit also known as S^3 originates from the need for a solely sustainability-focused conference that not just covers the environmental aspects of sustainability but also the social and economic aspects. This requires bringing together people from different backgrounds and fields of study and collecting their perspectives on sustainability issues. On top of it all, it is essential to truly provide "Sustainability for All" by removing any barriers that impede students' access to education, especially on a crucial topic such as sustainability.
